###_Graph processing challenges_

1) Is a graph biparite? 
Answer : You can use DFS to do it by labelling vertices in such a way to understand

2) Is a dating graph biparite
   Answer : Not these days

3) Find a cycle? 
   Answer: use DFS

4) Konigsberg bridge problem
   Answer : if its connected and if all vertices have even degree we can.
   
5) Find a cycle that uses every edge exactly once.
   Answer : use of biparte

6) Find a cycle that visits every vertex exactly once.
    Answer : Hamiliton cycle NP problem

7) Are two graphs are identical except vertex names
   Answer :  no one knows efficent one
   
8) Lay out graph in the plane without crossing edges
   Answer :  Linear time DFS based planarity algo by Tarjan
